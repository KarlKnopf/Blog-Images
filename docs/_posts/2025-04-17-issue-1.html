<p>Welcome to the first official transmission of <strong>The Intergalactic Newsletter</strong>!</p>

<p>In this inaugural issue, we proudly welcome the Megaska Galaxy into The Intergalactic Community.</p>

<p>From vibrant pink oceans to bioluminescent cities made of crystal, Megaska offers a dazzling display of cosmic variety. It’s no wonder it’s been nicknamed “The Jewel Cluster” by early diplomatic observers.</p>

<p>We’ll also take a look at early cultural exchanges and highlight the Dreltari species from Lok-Zok-Pon, a liquid planet teeming with life thanks to recent Society-funded technological integration programs.</p>
