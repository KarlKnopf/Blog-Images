<h2>üåå Welcome to the Neighborhood!</h2>

<p>
This is the first official transmission of <strong>The Intergalactic Society Newsletter</strong>, the premier source of updates for galaxies newly joining the Intergalactic Community.
</p>

<p>
In this issue, we explore the arrival of the Megaska Galaxy, cultural trends emerging from early cross-galactic exchanges, and the fascinating diversity of life now accessible through open hyperspace corridors.
</p>

<h3>ü™ê Featured Galaxy: Megaska</h3>

<p>
Megaska‚Äôs entrance marks a milestone in Intergalactic Society history. This spiral galaxy is home to billions of worlds, and their diplomatic delegation has been warmly received.
